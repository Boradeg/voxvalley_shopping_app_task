This Android app implements a user-friendly shopping experience with functionalities like:

- Data Fetching: Users seamlessly retrieve product data from a remote server API using the Ion library for asynchronous networking.
- Product Management: Users can add, update, and delete products, enabling dynamic inventory management.
- Search Functionality: Users can efficiently search for specific products within the app's inventory using a user-friendly search bar.
  
# Technical Stack
-Kotlin: Modern, concise, and type-safe language for robust Android development.
-XML: for design screens
-Coroutines: Powerful concurrency mechanism for efficient and non-blocking network interactions.
-MVVM Architecture: Well-defined separation of concerns for maintainable code and easier testing.
-Ion: Efficient library for handling asynchronous HTTP requests and responses.
-Remote Server API: Exposes the necessary endpoints (data retrieval, creation, update, deletion) for product management.
